SaveWaterPipesMultiUnit
============================
The "Save The Water Pipes" Multi Unit project is the code for the "Save The Water Pipes" system that was demoed in the final round of the 2016 China US Young Maker Competition.

To read more about this project, go to:

It is the "Multi Unit" version of the system because it was designed to monitor the state of the water pipes for a multi-unit system (such as an apartment building). It was built on top of the original system, which was designed to monitor the water pipe for a single unit building (like a single family home).

The "Single Unit" version of the system was built by re-purposing the sample Node.js application offered by Intel. You can read more about the sample application that the "Save The Water Pipes" Single Unit system was built on by reading README.md.orig
